<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>My name is Jake and I’m 23 years old. I was born in Australia and live in Melbourne. I finished high school in 2015 and have since worked on and off for my family’s business which is air-conditioning installation (split-systems). I have a pet Cavoodle name Billy who is 2 and a half years old, and I love taking him for walks. I am a very passionate Western Bulldogs fan since birth and have supported Chelsea FC in the English Premier League for nearly 15 years. </p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I have close to zero experience in IT. If you asked my parents they would think otherwise as I am always teaching them new things which I have taught myself. My only experience in IT just comes from everyday tasks that are involved with using a phone or computer. In VCE I was studying Information Technology units 3 and 4, but honestly was never interested in IT, I wasn’t really interested in anything during that stage of my life and was just going along. Over the past 18 months I’ve had lots of time to reflect and feel like it’s something I could grow a passion for, and I am eager to learn. (I am really enjoying programming in my Introduction to programming class)</p>
<p>I chose to enrol at RMIT to learn new skills and better myself. I have never undertaken anything like this since finishing high school and was feeling nervous about putting myself back into a classroom situation, but the online nature of RMIT gave me a little bit of comfort and a feeling of easing into things.</p>
<p>I hope that throughout the duration of my studies, I learn a wide variety of new skills and absorb knowledge from my tutors and peers. More specifically I hope to get an idea of what it is I want to do in the ever-growing field of Information Technology. </p>

<h2>Heres a snapshot if my position has been filled</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>An IT manager is responsible for managing a particular company’s hardware, software, security and networks, and its overall performance in the department.</p>
<h2>What is required?</h2>
<p>IT manager’s require a wide range of skills, such as having strong technical skills, negotiation skills, being an attentive listener and ability to communicate effectively. These are all important for being a successful IT Manager. IT managers commonly possess a relevant bachelor’s degree and have multiple years of experience on the job in the IT field.</p>
<h2>Me</h2>
<p>As I am writing this I have absolutely zero qualifications and experience, and very little skills required. But what I do have is a passion to learn and better myself which is what I am hoping to do so throughout the next several years.</p>
<h2>Learning Plan</h2>
<p>I am going to stay committed to my studies and successfully complete my Bachelor of Information Technology. And whilst doing so work on improving my ability to work in teams and be a great “teammate”.  I think I need to work on these areas I would consider myself weak in rather than just knowing and accepting what I’m comfortable with. </p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<h2>Myers-Briggs test</h2>
<img src="myersbriggs.jpg" style="width:600px;">
<p>I think these results are quite accurate to how I feel, they help me put into words how I would describe myself but, in the past, have be unable to due to a lack of understanding.
In team environments I defiantly feel uncomfortable (I don’t think this is uncommon for a lot of people), more so in the whole getting a team together and getting to know one another stages. I think I can be a great asset to the team once I’ve overcome these hurdles. </p>
<h2>Learning styles test</h2>
<img src="learningstyles.jpg" style="width:500px;">
<p>I’ve never really thought of different learning styles that individuals can have and how we are different so this test taught me something I didn’t know or couldn’t answer before. My test results suggested that I am more suited to visual learning as opposed to kinaesthetic and auditory learning. For example, I benefit more from visuals such as charts, graphs and diagrams, and notice visual details that others may have missed.
I don’t think these results necessarily will have a big influence on my behaviour in a team, as nobody has just one learning style. For me I am more than capable of learning through hands on experiences and I like to think I am a great listener.
When forming a team, I will consider that everyone is different and will have their own dominant learning style that may very well differ to mine, and I think its important everyone understands that if perhaps there is a conflict with the way information is being presented within the team. </p>
<h2>Big Five Personality test</h2>
<img src="bigfive.jpg" style="width:600px;height:350px;">
<p>The results of this kind of test can be a little confronting. I don’t have much else to say.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>
<p>My IT project idea is an application which can be downloaded onto the user’s smartphone via the app store and used as a form of social media. My idea which I have come up with revolves around connecting people who share a love for animals. It will be tailored for those who are looking for someone who can sit their pets if they are in an emergency, or just need someone they can trust who shares the same passion as them or perhaps just planning a walk in the local area with other dog owners, as a way to build friendships with neighbours.</p>
<p>My motivation for this idea comes from two main sources. I personally struggle to create friendships and interact socially, but from experience I’ve had positive interactions meeting others who also have pets and although it may seem crazy or odd to someone who might not feel the same, I know its defiantly a thing that other people can relate to. My other motivation for this application is to encourage more people to walk their dogs and perhaps make it more appealing if the “task” of walking a pet can be tied together with social interactions. </p>
<p>Each user on the application will have their own personal profile with personal information about themselves and their pets. The user will be able to fully customize their personal profiles with text and images and see the profiles of those who live nearby them via gps technology. This will give the user I sense of comfortability knowing there are like minded people out there who share the same passion. </p>
<p>An app development software will be needed, such as Quixy, AppyPie, iBuildApp etc. It will be a requirement having a great understanding of software development, specifically in web app development. The skills required for such a project include product management: the lead for a mobile app developper needs to dig into the business side of the app and its needs; user interface and user experience: this is necessary to be able to present your idea to potential users; communication: there may be many app developers working on the project and it important that every member is on the same page.</p>
